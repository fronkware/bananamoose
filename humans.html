<h2>Bath Mat</h2>
<p>How about waking up and getting a Banana Moose welcome to your day!? This assumes you shower in the morning, sorry if you don't, but this may make you want to. $20ish </p>

How will this work? I will send all the store profits to the charity. Yes, I wish I could automate it from the storefront, haven't figured that out yet. If that doesn't float your boat, donate directly! 😃</p>
