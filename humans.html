<h2>Bath Mat</h2>
<p>How about waking up and getting a Banana Moose welcome to your day!? This assumes you shower in the morning, sorry if you don't, but this may make you want to. $20ish </p>

<h2>A LEGIT SKATEBOARD</h2>

<p>All profits will go to the <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=8145">National Alliance to End Homelessness (91% on Charity Navigator)</a>. How will this work? I will send all the store profits to the charity. Yes, I wish I could automate it from the storefront, haven't figured that out yet. If that doesn't float your boat, donate directly! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>


<h2>DMC & FRIENDS insider deals</h2>
<p>I'm waiting on a quote on a bulk patch order (~2" embroidered patches), so if you want one, just venmo @frank-may $5 with the DMC office you want it shipped to. Aiming to have it figured out before black friday. No guarantees on quality, will refund if it's black friday and I don't have a good way to get you the patch. ONLY FOR DMC AND FRIENDS, no strangers.</p>
