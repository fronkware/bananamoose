<h1>Our History</h1>
<p>Founded in a small brain in Somerville almost sixty days ago, Banana Moose has grown into one of the world's leading makers of Banana Moose products.</p>
<h2>Why Banana Moose?</h2>
<p>We get asked that a lot.</p>
<p>Bananas and Moose together may seem as outlandish as wearing luxury arctic wear to a Starbucks, but it makes more sense if you think about it. Moose are found across Canada, in every province and territory except for Prince Edward Island. And you guessed it, there are also no Bananas growing on Prince Edward Island! It's so rare to find these organisms together, so their combination truly means something special.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why Banana though?</h2>
<p>Think about it.&nbsp;</p>
